Still a work in progress. If you have any questions, message 1joon on discord and I will try to help as much as possible.

***A simple tool to adjust your primary monitor's gamma (brightness/contrast) on Windows. Useful for gaming, reducing eye strain, or adjusting display settings on the fly. **Or just use it to bypass osu gamma detection lmfao**

## How to Run

1. Download both files (`gamma_control.bat` and `SetGamma.ps1`)
2. Place them in the same folder
3. Right-click `gamma_control.bat` → Run as Administrator
4. If Windows Defender prompts you, click "More info" → "Run anyway"
